# A-Star-algorithm

I made a challenge from dailyprogrammer
https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2o5tb7/2014123_challenge_191_intermediate_space_probe/

Using my implementation of A* algorithm, my application is searching way from Start (S) point to End (E) point. More details about requirements are in a link above.

This application was written in Qt (Qt Console Application) using C++11 (for a few 'for' loops).

To understand how A* works this movie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L-WgKMFuhE was very helpful for me.
