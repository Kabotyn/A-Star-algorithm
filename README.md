# A-Star-algorithm

I made a challenge from dailyprogrammer http://goo.gl/mXmu6a

Using my implementation of A* algorithm, my application is searching way from Start (S) point to End (E) point. More details about requirements are in a link above.

This application was written in Qt (Qt Console Application) using C++11 (for a few 'for' loops).

To understand how A* works this movie: https://youtu.be/-L-WgKMFuhE was very helpful for me.
